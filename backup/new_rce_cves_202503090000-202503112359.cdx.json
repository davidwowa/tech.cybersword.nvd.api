      "description" : "picklescan before 0.0.23 fails to detect malicious pickle files inside PyTorch model archives when certain ZIP file flag bits are modified. By flipping specific bits in the ZIP file headers, an attacker can embed malicious pickle files that remain undetected by PickleScan while still being successfully loaded by PyTorch's torch.load(). This can lead to arbitrary code execution when loading a compromised model.",

      "description" : "A vulnerability, that could result in Remote Code Execution (RCE), has been found in PlotAI. Lack of validation of LLM-generated output allows attacker to execute arbitrary Python code. Vendor commented out vulnerable line, further usage of the software requires uncommenting it and thus accepting the risk. The vendor does not plan to release a patch to fix this vulnerability.",
