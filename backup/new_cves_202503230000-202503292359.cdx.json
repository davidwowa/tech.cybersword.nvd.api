This repro installs a taprio qdisc, but providing an invalid TCA_RATE attribute. qdisc_create() has to destroy the just initialized taprio qdisc, and taprio_destroy() is called. However, the hrtimer used by taprio had already fired, therefore advance_sched() called __netif_schedule(). Then net_tx_action was trying to use a destroyed qdisc. We can not undo the __netif_schedule(), so we must wait until one cpu serviced the qdisc before we can proceed. Many thanks to Alexander Potapenko for his help.

      "description" : "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: nfc: Fix use-after-free in local_cleanup() Fix a use-after-free that occurs in kfree_skb() called from local_cleanup(). This could happen when killing nfc daemon (e.g. neard) after detaching an nfc device. When detaching an nfc device, local_cleanup() called from nfc_llcp_unregister_device() frees local->rx_pending and decreases local->ref by kref_put() in nfc_llcp_local_put(). In the terminating process, nfc daemon releases all sockets and it leads to decreasing local->ref. After the last release of local->ref, local_cleanup() called from local_release() frees local->rx_pending again, which leads to the bug. Setting local->rx_pending to NULL in local_cleanup() could prevent use-after-free when local_cleanup() is called twice. Found by a modified version of syzkaller.
