      "description" : "In MITRE Caldera through 4.2.0 and 5.0.0 before 35bc06e, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was found in the dynamic agent (implant) compilation functionality of the server. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server that Caldera is running on via a crafted web request to the Caldera server API used for compiling and downloading of Caldera's Sandcat or Manx agent (implants). This web request can use the gcc -extldflags linker flag with sub-commands.",

      "description" : "The Everest Forms â€“ Contact Forms, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter & Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload, read, and deletion due to missing file type and path validation in the 'format' method of the EVF_Form_Fields_Upload class in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.9.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload, read, and delete arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution, sensitive information disclosure, or a site takeover possible.",
